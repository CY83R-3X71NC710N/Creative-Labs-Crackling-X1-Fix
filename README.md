# New-Solution:

Actually, I have found that you can hack the brain itself into thinking there is no crackling if you play rain sounds from myNoise in the background as you listen to music, they blend together thus there is no crackling and you get to enjoy the atmosphere of rain. Or even better, listen to a fire crackling. I suggest doing a targeted EQ approach with the low treble, treble, and high treble cranked to the point where the crackling is indistinguishable and zeroing out all other frequencies and sounds.

# Creative Labs Crackling X1 Fix

This project provides a simple shell script to automatically fix frequent audio crackling issues with Creative Labs audio devices on macOS. The script periodically restarts the core audio engine plugin, which is quickly relaunched by macOS, minimizing audio interruption.

## How It Works

- The script kills the `AudioServerDriverPlugin.app` process at a configurable interval.
- macOS automatically restarts the plugin, clearing up audio crackling without requiring a full system reboot or audio device replug.

## Usage

1. **Open Terminal** and navigate to this directory:
   ```sh
   cd /workspaces/Creative-Labs-Crackling-X1-Fix
   ```

2. **Make the script executable** (if not already):
   ```sh
   chmod +x creativesoundfix.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   ./creativesoundfix.sh
   ```

   - The script will run indefinitely, resetting the audio plugin at the configured interval.
   - Press `Control+C` to stop.

## Configuration

- Open `creativesoundfix.sh` in a text editor.
- Change the value of `RESTART_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to set how often the plugin is restarted (in seconds).
  - Example: `RESTART_INTERVAL_SECONDS=120` (every 2 minutes)

## Notes

- This script is intended for macOS systems using Creative Labs audio devices.
- Minimal audio interruption is expected during each reset.
- No system reboot or device replug is required.

# Why this is the best solution

Utilizing AI to detect the crackling will never be as good as this solution, the detection of crackling in music, specifically due to it seeming to be most-prevelant in the right-earphone, will be difficult to provide audio spikes and false positives will remain. Therefore, without reverse engineering the driver (highly difficult) to fix it, the only other good solution would be waiting for creative to fix the problem.
